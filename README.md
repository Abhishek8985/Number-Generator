# Number-Generator
This project is a simple number generator that visualizes numbers up to a user-defined limit. Built using JavaScript DOM manipulation, it dynamically creates and displays a grid of numbers with different background colors based on their properties:

Green for even numbers.
Yellow for odd numbers.
Red for prime numbers.
The user can input any number, and the grid will automatically generate and color the numbers accordingly. This project demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, dynamic HTML creation, and CSS styling using JavaScript.

I have done this project completely using JavaScript as part of my learning in 30 days of JavaScript.
I created basic structure of HTML and the reamaining every element is created and handled using Js only.
